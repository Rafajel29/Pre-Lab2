My 10 ideas for using the timer of the micro controller

1) Having a row of LED's with only one lit at a time and quickly changing witch one is lit and then having to press a button when the right one is lit.

2) Having a row of LED's with only one lit at a time and quickly changing witch one is lit then the light goes out and the player needs to guess where it stopped.

3) A shower timer that you start when getting in the shower that plays a tune when a specified time has passed.

4) A gym timer that you start after a set then like a minute before the specified rest is over it beeps to inform you get ready and then when time is up beeps again to indicate you need to start.

5) Timer that can be used for cooking.

6) A chess clock that has two times. One counts down while its the players turn then when he presses the button indicating the other persons turn his stop and the other persons clock start counting down.

7) LED's will flash in a pattern and then you need to press buttons in the same pattern afterwards.

8) Russian roullete where if you press the button you get either green or red then the next person must press until someone gets red.

9) A timer for studying helping to indicate when it's ime for a break.

10) You can make a fitness beep test from it. Where it beeps you have to then reach a point before it beeps again then back again with pauses between beep getting shorter and shorter.
